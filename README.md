# fragility-curves
A fragility curve plugin for cloud wat.

The fragility curve plugin takes a set of input seeds representing natural variability and knowledge uncertainty for a given event, and will sample all fragility curves with a curve sample using the knowledge uncertainty seed, and a value sample (failure elevation) using the event seed.
